 HackerRank Practice - Coding Challenges Progression

Description

Welcome to my HackerRank practice repository! Here, I’m documenting my journey as I tackle coding challenges across various difficulty levels, from the hardest problems to the easier ones. My aim is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and build confidence in my coding abilities by systematically working through a wide range of challenges.

Objectives

- **Diverse Practice:** I want to practice coding challenges from all difficulty levels on HackerRank.
- **Skill Development:** My goal is to develop a stronger grasp of algorithms and data structures.
- **Optimized Solutions:** I aim to learn optimized approaches and improve my problem-solving speed.
- **Progress Tracking:** By starting with complex problems and gradually moving to simpler ones, I can effectively track my learning progress.
- **Portfolio Building:** I’m building a diverse portfolio of solutions that cover multiple problem types.

Project Structure

- The repository is organized into folders based on difficulty levels: **Hard**, **Medium**, and **Easy**.
- Each folder contains solved problems, complete with clear code and comments to explain my thought process.
- The problems span various topics, including arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, sorting, and more.
