HackerRank Practice - Coding Challenges Progression
Description
Welcome to my HackerRank practice repository! This is where I’m sharing my journey as I work through coding challenges, starting with the easier ones and gradually tackling the more difficult problems. My goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and boost my confidence in coding by systematically exploring a variety of challenges.

Objectives
Diverse Practice: I want to engage with coding challenges across all difficulty levels on HackerRank.
Skill Development: My aim is to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
Optimized Solutions: I’m eager to learn efficient approaches and enhance my problem-solving speed.
Progress Tracking: By beginning with simpler problems and moving towards the more complex ones, I can effectively monitor my learning journey.
Portfolio Building: I’m creating a diverse portfolio of solutions that cover a wide range of problem types.
Project Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
Each folder contains solved problems, complete with clear code and comments that explain my thought process.
The challenges cover various topics, including arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, sorting, and more.
